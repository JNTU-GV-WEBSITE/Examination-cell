          <Typography className="t">An examination cell is an administrative unit within educational institutions such as colleges,
           and universities responsible for managing various aspects of examinations. It oversees the planning, organization, and 
           execution of exams, aiming to ensure efficiency and integrity throughout the process. Students interact with the examination
            cell to register for exams, whether for regular examinations or supplementary ones. Additionally, the examination cell 
            handles the generation of hall tickets or admit cards, providing students with essential exam details such as date, time,
             and venue.</Typography><br/>

             <Typography className="t">Detailed exam timetables are coordinated and published by the examination cell, enabling 
            students to plan their study schedules effectively. Following the completion of exams, the examination cell promptly
             publishes results, allowing students to access their scores and grades online. It effectively manages student data 
             related to exams, including registration details, exam scores, and academic records, ensuring organized and easily 
             accessible information.</Typography><br/>
          

            <Typography className="t">The examination cell serves as a central hub for disseminating important announcements and notifications 
            related to exams, including any changes in schedule or exam patterns. Moreover, it facilitates online fee payment for exams, 
            enhancing convenience for students and reducing administrative burdens. Furthermore, students submit exam-related forms,
             such as applications for revaluation or supplementary exams, to the examination cell through designated channels. 
             This streamlined process minimizes paperwork and administrative overhead. Feedback from students and faculty regarding 
             the examination process is welcomed by the examination cell, as it contributes to ongoing improvements in services and 
             procedures. Additionally, the examination cell maintains and secures student data related to exams, ensuring organized
              and accessible information.</Typography><br/>
